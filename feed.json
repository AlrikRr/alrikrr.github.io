I had an absolute blast, met a bunch of friends, and made connections with some truly incredible individuals.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">What struck me most was the fact that Montreal's cyber community is relatively small, yet you often find yourself running into familiar faces.

            "content_html": "<p>Are you tired of limited tokens and cloud-based AI models? Well, let me introduce Ollama!</p>\n<h1>What is ollama</h1>\n<p>Ollama is a tool that will allow you to run a wide variety of open-source large language models (LLMs) directly on your local machine, without the need for any subscription or internet access (except for downloading the tool and the models, of course! :D ).</p>\n<p>For now, it is only compatible with Linux and MacOS,  the Windows one is on the way with a \"Preview\" version. Here is the website link if you are curious: <a href=\"https://ollama.com/download\">https://ollama.com/download</a> </p>\n<p>Oh! If you really want to install it (kind of) on your Windows machine, I can recommend you the video of Network Chuck, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxYC9-hBM_g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">where he installs Ollama using WSL</a>!</p>\n<p>Before doing anything, it's important to note that depending on the machine you'll run your models on, the waiting time can be long. On my side, I'm using a MacBook Air M2 with 8GB RAM (Don't judge me here), and for a simple question, it can take 15 to 20 seconds. For example, if I ask for a quote from The Office, it will take around 30-40 seconds.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/theoffice.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"167\"></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>System requirements for running models ; minimum of 8 GB of RAM is needed for 3B parameter models, 16 GB for 7B, and 32 GB for 13B models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/8k2aku.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"453\"></figure></h1>\n<h1>REST API</h1>\n<p>Once Ollama is installed on your local machine, you'll notice that port number <code>11434</code> is open from your localhost IP. This port can be used to communicate directly using the curl command if you'd like. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre class=\"p1\">curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{ \"model\": \"llama2\", \"prompt\":\"Give me a quote from The Office\" }'</pre>\n<p>It can be an interesting way to set up a local server on your home network and then access it from another machine. You can open that port to the internet (or via a VPN), and now you have your own ChatGPT accessible from anywhere!</p>\n<h1>Where to find my models</h1>\n<p>Ollama provides many different models that you can check on their website. They offer specialized coding models, medical models, uncensored ones, and more. It's up to you to choose which one suits your needs. Keep in mind that all the models are open-source and regularly updated by the community. New models can also emerge from time to time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ollama.com/library\">https://ollama.com/library</a> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/ai-meme.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"972\" height=\"662\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/responsive/ai-meme-xs.png 300w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/responsive/ai-meme-sm.png 480w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/37/responsive/ai-meme-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<h1>How to install</h1>\n<p>The installation process is quite simple.

During this presentation, I used an old TP-Link router as an example, connecting to the URAT port to gain access.

Today I’m going to share with you my feedback on the PNPT certification that I passed at the beginning of August 2023 by reviewing the before and during the exam!</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"post__toc\">\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#my-knowledge\">My Knowledge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggn\">PNPT &amp; Package Course</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggo\">Exam Period - 5 Days</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggp\">Exam Skills</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggq\">Exam Package</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggr\">My Exam</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggs\">Report Period - 2 days</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggt\">Final Presentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"my-knowledge\">My Background</h1>\n<p>Before we dive deeper, let me clarify my experience since I see few people talking about their skills before starting the examination. I have 4 years of experience in the field of computer security, with 2 actual years spent as a Pentester. I frequently practice at home, as well as during missions conducting intrusion tests on both internal and external client environments. Moreover, report writing is no longer a mysterious art for me. So, I’m embarking on this certification with a significant advantage compared to someone new to this field. 🛡️</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/pnpt-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"297\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/pnpt-2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/pnpt-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/pnpt-2-md.jpeg 768w\"></figure>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggn\">PNPT &amp; Package Course</h1>\n<p>Before purchasing the PNPT courses and voucher, it’s essential to note that the two exam vouchers do not have an expiration date. The courses are available on the Academic TCM-Security platform, and you’ll be provided with five courses, along with their completion percentages, to give you an idea of what I’ve gone through so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course <strong>94%</strong></li>\n<li>Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners <strong>75%</strong></li>\n<li>Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners <strong>0%</strong></li>\n<li>Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals <strong>0%</strong></li>\n<li>External Pentest Playbook <strong>0%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you’ll have access to VODs of Twitch live sessions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PNPT Live Training VOD <strong>0%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">Please note that just because I haven’t finished all the courses doesn’t mean you should follow suit. As I mentioned earlier, I’m starting with an advantage.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggo\">Exam Period - 5 Days</h1>\n<p>It’s go-time! You’ve set up your Kali Linux virtual machine, and the countdown has begun!</p>\n<p>You’ve got 5 days to conquer this examination, which means compromising both the external and internal scope, “securing” that Domain Admin access to the Domain Controller! All’s fair in this quest, but just remember, you’ll be following a step-by-step process, just like on a genuine pentesting engagement with a client. So, no DDOS or other disruptions – they could spell the end of your exam period!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggp\">Exam Skills</h2>\n<p>If I can offer you a few tips on the areas to review and master before taking the exam, here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)</li>\n<li>Web Application Pentesting</li>\n<li>Pivoting and Proxychains</li>\n<li>Active Directory Pentesting</li>\n<li>Enumeration, Enumeration, ENUMERATION!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggq\">Exam Package</h2>\n<p>Regarding your Exam Package, you’ll receive a PDF document containing your scope and instructions from your client. You can also make use of the password wordlists kindly provided by TCM (it’ll make your life easier!).</p>\n<p>Lastly, you’ll receive your VPN access for the lab and the option to revert or stop the lab whenever you want. This won’t affect the lab’s configuration or the exam duration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggr\">My Exam</h2>\n<p>As for me, I faced a few challenges during the enumeration phase. I won’t say more to avoid spoiling anything! The attacks weren’t overly difficult; they’re entirely manageable even for beginners if you follow the courses provided by TCM.</p>\n<p>Still, it’s a lab exam that somewhat mirrors reality, even though everything is designed to give you hints about where to look and what to do without causing too many issues.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/meme-0.jpg\" alt=\"Private PNPT joke\" width=\"369\" height=\"298\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-0-xs.jpg 300w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-0-sm.jpg 480w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-0-md.jpg 768w\"></figure>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggs\">Report Period - 2 days</h1>\n<p>When it comes to the report writing phase, it’s also nothing overly complicated. I can only advise you to capture screenshots BEFORE your exam period ends!</p>\n<p>As for what I did, I took notes on the vulnerabilities I discovered and how to exploit them. It’s important to provide Proof of Concepts (PoCs) but also suggestions for fixing them. Remember, this report is intended for a client, so write it accordingly. Include both the technical and executive aspects.</p>\n<p>My report ended up being a total of 60 pages. I can list the main headings for you to give you an idea of the content, in case it helps inspire you!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective &amp; Context</li>\n<li>Scope</li>\n<li>Server Discovery</li>\n<li>Testing Methodology</li>\n<li>Score &amp; Severity</li>\n<li>Executive Summary</li>\n<li>Vulnerability Summary</li>\n<li>Remediation Summary</li>\n<li>Attack Paths</li>\n<li>Technical Details (Vulnerability Details and PoCs)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/meme-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"517\" height=\"499\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-1-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-1-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/meme-1-md.jpeg 768w\"></figure>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1h7tmfdnggt\">Final Presentation</h1>\n<p>Aside from the technical hiccups at the beginning of the presentation (well, you can’t really hide the chaos, can you…), it was quite swift – no more than 15 minutes – with a few questions from the examiner. On my end, I jumped right into presenting the English PDF report (with my French Baguette accent).</p>\n<p>The atmosphere was friendly, with no pressure as long as you’re confident in your subject! The advantage is that the examiner will give you the final verdict right away, letting you know if you’ve earned your certification or not.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/pnpt-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"225\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://alrikrr.github.io/media/posts/2/pnpt-4.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"202\"></figure>\n<div id=\"post-content\" class=\"post-content\">\n<p>It’s still a great experience with TCM-Security. If you have any questions, I can answer them without revealing the exam’s content. As for me, I’m leaning towards the next certification in Malware Analysis, PJMR!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row pl-3 pr-3\"> </div>",
